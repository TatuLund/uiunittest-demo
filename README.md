This is demo application of how to do UI unit testing with Vaadin 23 Spring Boot application using
Vaadin TestBench.

Documentation:

https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/testing/ui-unit

UI Unit Tests are run via mocked Vaadin system without a browser, thus they run quicker. Check the example 
test story in `AddressViewTest.java`.

- Open `AddressView`
- Input a new address in the `Form`
- Click `Save`
- Verify `Notification` with correct message
- Trigger `Grid` filter.
- Verify that new address appears in `Grid`
- Select the newly added address in `Grid`
- Verify that `Form` is populated by new address
- Click `Delete`
- Verify `Notification` with correct message

For sake of comparison the same user story is included as TestBench/Selenium based browser test
in `AddressViewIT.java`

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different 
IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/register-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `frontend/` contains the custom CSS styles.
